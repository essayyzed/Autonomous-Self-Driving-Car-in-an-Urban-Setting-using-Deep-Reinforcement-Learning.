# HyperDrive : Autonomous Self-Driving Car in an Urban Setting using Deep Reinforcement Learning
In this project, HyperDrive uses deep reinforcement learning to train a self-driving car
in an urban and dynamic simulated environment. Apart from training the car, it will
also do route planning to get the best optimum path to its destination. This project is
being conducted in the CARLA simulator offering a customizable and realistic urban
environment that is specially designed for autonomous driving research.
For our car to learn in the simulated urban environment of CARLA, a deep reinforcement
learning model called DQN and DDQN is used. For routing D* search is used which will
drive the agent through the shortest path in optimal way.
